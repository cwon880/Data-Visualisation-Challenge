## Data Visualisation Internship Challenge
The following is my submission of the Quantiful data visualisation challenge, it was a fun, and at times frustrating experience, tackling a new language that I have not used before. I managed to successully reformat the car and phone sales data to match the format given by the formattedSales dataset and I also successfully visualised this data into a line chart. However, some shortcuts were taken made due to time constraints as I had to use a for loop to format the extracted data figures. There was also some code duplication in my data formatter function as I essentially repeated the use of the nested map functions to extract the car and phone sales data. I'm sure theres a better way to reformat the data but given the time constraints this was the design decision I made.

### How to run

To run my submission, 'npm install' will be needed to download all the node modules as I decided to not push the large node modules folder onto github (stack overflow suggested to do this), Apologies for any inconvenience caused.

### Goals of this challenge

Main goal: Use recharts library to visualise car and phone sales data in the education tab.

Easy(ish) goal: Use the formatted data provided and then choose and create an appropriate graph to represent the data

Stretch goal: if successful with using the already formatted data, then try to reformat the data given myself and then apply the new data to the graph.

### Challenges to be faced

-I have never used javascript, react or recharts before, will need to do a lot of googling into how it all works, will especially need to look into how to reformat data with javascript syntax
-Will need to research into the recharts API to understand what kind of data is required to generate their graphs
-Haven't used git and github in a while since taking a git101 bootcamp course last semester, will have to remember how to commit, push etc again.
-Time constraint, can't spend too much time researching without producing deliverables
